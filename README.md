Create a file that represent the tree of references starting from a publication.
It uses the Semantic Scholar API to retrieve the publications. There are limitations to this API so retrieving a publication will most probably fail several times before success, this is done automatically.
Aside the limitations of the API, the number of publications increase greatly with the depth of the tree, making this tool not very practical. Other tools, such as https://www.connectedpapers.com/, are more convenient.
